Scripts to analyse a body of literature

Step 1. Search in Scopus
* Use the document search to query for a number of search terms in titles,
abstracts and keywords, where the search terms are separated with AND.
* Select all documents found and use the export function. Select the complete
format and export to a csv file.

Step 2. Use the scripts to reformat the resulting csv file to generate an overview of authors, papers and keywords.
* Use generateAuthorOverview.sh to give an overview of the authors. The resulting .edges file contains an overview of the links between authors.
* Use generateDocumentOverview.sh to give an overview of the documents. The resulting .edges file contains an overview of the citation links between documents.
* Use generateKeywordOverview.sh to give an overview of the keywords listed. The resulting .edges file contains an overview of the keywords that are mentioned together. The keywords-count.txt files gives an ordered count of the keywords. 

Step 3. Harmonise the result in Google Refine
* The result may need to be improved to resolve unmatched duplicates with Google Refine. 
* Especially authors and documents need to be checked, because the same author and documents have different identifiers (for example ‘Nelson, R.’ and ‘Nelson, R.R.’).
* Use the Cluster and edit function to find similar values and determine which should be duplicates. There are various clustering algorithms implemented.
* Also use this function to combine various editions of the same publication into one document identifier.
* Change everything to lower case. Remove malformatted references.
* Use the Facet by Blank function to deselect empty cells.
* Export the result as a tab-separated file.

Step 4. Visualise and explore literature network with Gephi.
* All three lists are imported in Gephi to study the network.
* Check by hand for duplicate nodes and use the Merge nodes function.
* Remove erroneous nodes (such as commas only, or ‘from china’).
* Use the data explorer function to calculate general statistics of the networks and get an overview of the mostly cited papers.
* The network may be visualized best by using the ForceAtlas layout, by making the size of the nodes based on the degree.
* Export the resulting networks.
